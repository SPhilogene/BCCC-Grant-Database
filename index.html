            Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National
            Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for P50 Research Center
            Grants for Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE).
            Based on the research proposed, applications may be jointly funded
            with the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
            (NIDCR). The program will fund P50 SPORE grants to support
            state-of-the-art investigator-initiated translational research that
            will contribute to improved prevention, early detection, diagnosis,
            and treatment of an organ-specific cancer or a highly related group
            of cancers. For the purpose of this NOFO, a group of highly related
            cancers are those that are derived from the same organ system, such
            as gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, head and neck, and other
            cancers. Other programmatically appropriate groups of cancers may
            include those centered around a common biological mechanism critical
            for promoting tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression in organ sites
            that belong to different organ systems. For example, a SPORE may
            focus on cancers caused by the same infectious agent or cancers
            promoted and sustained by dysregulation of a common signaling
            pathway. In addition, a SPORE may focus on cross-cutting themes such
            as pediatric cancers or cancer health disparities. The research
            supported through this program must be translational and must stem
            from research on human biology using cellular, molecular,
            structural, biochemical, and/or genetic experimental approaches.
            SPORE projects must have the goal of reaching a translational human
            endpoint within the project period of the grant.</details>

            infrastructure, Research and Development (R&amp;D) capacity, and
            hence, its R&amp;D competitiveness. The FEC program (formerly known
            as "EPSCoR Track-2 program") builds inter-jurisdictional
            collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in Science, Technology,
            Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) focus areas consistent with the
            current National Science Foundation Strategic Plan. Projects are
            investigator-driven and must include researchers from at least two
            EPSCoR eligible jurisdictions with complementary expertise and
            resources necessary to address challenges, which neither party could
            address as well or as rapidly independently. FEC projects have a
            comprehensive and integrated vision to drive discovery and build
            sustainable STEM capacity that exemplifies institutional,
            geographic, and disciplinary diversity. The projects' STEM research
            and education activities seek to broaden participation through the
            strategic inclusion and integration of all individuals,
            institutions, and sectors. Additionally, EPSCoR recognizes that the
            development of early-career faculty is critical to sustaining and

            Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National
            Cancer Institute (NCI) invites research grant applications (R01) for
            the development and application of current and emerging molecular
            imaging methods to gain fundamental insights into cancer
            inflammation in vivo. The motivation for this initiative is the
            recognition that much of the current imaging research on
            inflammation in cancer relies heavily on in vitro and ex vivo
            methods. These approaches have limited potential to provide
            significant insights into the dynamic interactions between cancer
            and inflammation. Utilizing molecular imaging probes in pre-clinical
            and clinical investigations allows for precise temporal resolution
            at molecular and cellular levels. This information is valuable for
            identifying and characterizing in vivo inflammatory cellular
            physiology in cancer and for detecting molecular changes in response
            to treatment. This NOFO encourages applications focused on
            developing integrated imaging approaches to investigate the role of
            inflammation in cancer through strong cross-discipline collaboration
            between cancer basic science researchers and imaging scientists.
            These collaborations are expected to advance the science and
            understanding of cancer inflammation interactions.</details>

            This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will solicit mechanistic
            research that aims to understand how and why expectancy effects
            occur in a cancer context, elucidate their role in cancer symptom
            management, and identify patients, symptoms, cancer sites, and
            contexts in which expectancy effects can be leveraged to improve
            cancer outcomes. Expectancies are defined in this context as beliefs
            about future outcomes, including one&rsquo;s response to cancer or
            cancer treatment. Expectancies can be evoked by social,
            psychological, environmental, and systemic factors. Expectancy
            effects are the cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes
            caused by expectancies. Expectancy effects can be generated by
            expectancies held by patients, clinicians, family members,
            caregivers, and/or dyadic/social networks. Program is particularly
            interested in applications that enroll individuals and groups from
            populations historically underrepresented or excluded from
            biomedical and behavioral research.</details>

            Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National
            Cancer Institute (NCI) encourages the submission of applications
            that propose to advance research in cancer etiology and early
            detection biomarkers, utilizing the advantages of the unique
            biorepository resources of the NCI-sponsored Prostate, Lung,
            Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial. The PLCO
            Biorepository offers high-quality, prospectively collected, serial
            pre-diagnostic blood samples from the PLCO screened arm
            participants, and buccal cells from both the screened and the
            control arm participants. Available data associated with the
            biospecimens includes demographic, diet, lifestyle, smoking,
            screening results, and other clinical data. This NOFO supports a
            wide range of cancer research including, but not limited to,
            biochemical and genetic analyses of cancer risk, as well as
            discovery and validation of early detection biomarkers. The proposed
            research project must involve use of PLCO biospecimens and may
            include other resources; additionally, it should also take advantage
            of the unique characteristics of the PLCO biospecimens. Research on
            non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g.,
            Alzheimer&rsquo;s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis and
            rheumatoid arthritis) may also be supported. Research projects that
            do not involve the use of PLCO biospecimens will not be supported
            under this NOFO.</details>

            side effect profile compared to other classes of incretin mimetics.
            In addition, this NOFO seeks to draw in talented scientists to the

            ECR&rsquo;s Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR:
            BCSER) supports projects that build investigators&rsquo; capacity to
            carry out high-quality STEM education research that will enhance the
            nation&rsquo;s STEM education enterprise. In addition, ECR: BCSER
            seeks to broaden the pool of researchers who can advance knowledge
            regarding STEM learning and learning environments, broadening
            participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.
            Researchers of races and ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations,
            and abilities who are currently underrepresented in their
            participation in STEM education research and the STEM workforce, as
            well as faculty at minority-serving and two-year institutions, are
            particularly encouraged to submit proposals. Specifically, ECR:
            BCSER supports activities that enable researchers to expand their
            areas of expertise and acquire the requisite knowledge and skills to
            conduct rigorous research in STEM education. Career development may
            be accomplished through investigator-initiated professional
            development and research projects or through institutes that enable
            researchers to integrate methodological strategies with theoretical
            and practical issues in STEM education.</details>

            The main goal of the S-STEM program is to enable low-income students
            with academic ability, talent or potential to pursue successful
            careers in promising STEM fields. Ultimately, the S-STEM program
            seeks to increase the number of academically promising low-income
            students who graduate with a S-STEM eligible degree and contribute
            to the American innovation economy with their STEM knowledge.
            Recognizing that financial aid alone cannot increase retention and
            graduation in STEM, the program provides awards to institutions of
            higher education (IHEs) not only to fund scholarships, but also to
            adapt, implement, and study evidence-based curricular and
            co-curricular activities that have been shown to be effective
            supporting recruitment, retention, transfer (if appropriate),
            student success, academic/career pathways, and graduation in STEM.</details>

            The NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research
            educational activities that complement other formal training
            programs in the mission areas of the NIH Institutes and Centers. The
            overarching goals of the NIH R25 program are to: (1) complement
            and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the
            nation&rsquo;s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs;
            (2) encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those
            from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral
            sciences, to pursue further studies or careers in research; (3) help
            recruit individuals with specific specialty or disciplinary
            backgrounds to research careers in biomedical, behavioral and
            clinical sciences; and (4) foster a better understanding of
            biomedical, behavioral and clinical research and its implications.
            The overarching goal of this R25 program is to support educational
            activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a
            workforce to meet the nation&rsquo;s biomedical, behavioral and
            clinical research needs. To accomplish the stated over-arching goal,
            this FOA will support creative educational activities with a primary
            focus on Research Experiences for high school students,
            undergraduate students, and/or science teachers during the summer
