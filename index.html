                        Accelerator Award is to support the commercialization of an ongoing cancer research project and
                        to validate and de-risk technologies. Proposals should address key experiment(s) required to
                        move findings toward commercialization that do not easily fit into traditional grant funding
                        mechanisms. This mechanism is not designed to initiate new projects or develop new directions
                        for an ongoing project. The proposal should be commercially driven with the PI having a plan to
                        license the technology, either to an established company or a start-up if the experiment(s) are
                        successful. Examples of research that align with the focus of this funding initiative include
                        but are not limited to: dosing, toxicity and/or efficacy testing; testing of biopsies or other
                        patient samples to correlate clinical outcome; or technologies for healthcare delivery.
                        Accelerator awardees will become part of an entrepreneurial collaborative learning community
                        focused on technology commercialization. Grantees will have access to both educational
                        programming developed by the ACS BrightEdge team and the team itself.

                        National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) aim to
                        foster the advancement and accelerate the growth of early-career scientists transitioning to
                        entrepreneurship by simultaneously supporting their entrepreneurial development and the conduct
                        of research and development under their direction. This NOFO supports small business concerns
                        (SBCs) in employing and developing researchers as entrepreneurial Program Directors/Principal
                        Investigators (PDs/PIs). In addition to supporting research and development efforts at the SBC,
                        a major component of this NOFO is entrepreneurial training, mentoring, and career development of
                        the PD/PI. Optimal PDs/PIs for this award are scientists and professionals with research,
                        technology development, and/or healthcare delivery skills and experience, but limited
                        entrepreneurial and independent (non-mentored) research leadership experience. PDs/PIs are
                        expected to grow their entrepreneurial skillset while working in a small business to develop
                        promising technologies and products that align with NIH's or CDC’s missions to improve health
                        and save lives.

                        Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National
                        Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for P50 Research Center
                        Grants for Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE).
                        Based on the research proposed, applications may be jointly funded
                        with the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
                        (NIDCR). The program will fund P50 SPORE grants to support
                        state-of-the-art investigator-initiated translational research that
                        will contribute to improved prevention, early detection, diagnosis,
                        and treatment of an organ-specific cancer or a highly related group
                        of cancers. For the purpose of this NOFO, a group of highly related
                        cancers are those that are derived from the same organ system, such
                        as gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, head and neck, and other
                        cancers. Other programmatically appropriate groups of cancers may
                        include those centered around a common biological mechanism critical
                        for promoting tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression in organ sites
                        that belong to different organ systems. For example, a SPORE may
                        focus on cancers caused by the same infectious agent or cancers
                        promoted and sustained by dysregulation of a common signaling
                        pathway. In addition, a SPORE may focus on cross-cutting themes such
                        as pediatric cancers or cancer health disparities. The research
                        supported through this program must be translational and must stem
                        from research on human biology using cellular, molecular,
                        structural, biochemical, and/or genetic experimental approaches.
                        SPORE projects must have the goal of reaching a translational human
                        endpoint within the project period of the grant.

                        Through this program, NSF establishes partnerships with government,
                        higher education, and industry that are designed to affect
                        sustainable improvements in a jurisdiction's research
                        infrastructure, Research and Development (R&amp;D) capacity, and
                        hence, its R&amp;D competitiveness. The FEC program (formerly known
                        as "EPSCoR Track-2 program") builds inter-jurisdictional
                        collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in Science, Technology,
                        Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) focus areas consistent with the
                        current National Science Foundation Strategic Plan. Projects are
                        investigator-driven and must include researchers from at least two
                        EPSCoR eligible jurisdictions with complementary expertise and
                        resources necessary to address challenges, which neither party could
                        address as well or as rapidly independently. FEC projects have a
                        comprehensive and integrated vision to drive discovery and build
                        sustainable STEM capacity that exemplifies institutional,
                        geographic, and disciplinary diversity. The projects' STEM research
                        and education activities seek to broaden participation through the
                        strategic inclusion and integration of all individuals,
                        institutions, and sectors. Additionally, EPSCoR recognizes that the
                        development of early-career faculty is critical to sustaining and
                        advancing research capacity.

                        investigators to accelerate the development and adoption of
                        promising bioengineering tools and technologies that can address
                        important biomedical problems. The objectives are to establish these
                        tools and technologies as robust, well-characterized solutions that
                        fulfill an unmet need and are capable of enhancing our understanding
                        of life science processes or the practice of medicine. Awards will
                        focus on supporting multidisciplinary teams that apply an
                        integrative, quantitative bioengineering approach to developing
                        technologies. The goal of the program is to support technological

                        Because of recent technological advances in synthetic biology and
                        bioengineering, researchers are now able to tailor cells and
                        cell-like systems for a variety of basic and applied research
                        purposes. The goal of this solicitation is to support research that
                        (1) develops cell-like systems to identify the minimal requirements
                        for the processes of life, (2) designs synthetically-modified cells
                        to address fundamental questions in the evolution of life or to
                        explore biological diversity beyond that which currently exists in
                        nature, and (3) leverages basic research in cell design to build
                        novel synthetic cell-like systems and cells for innovative
                        biotechnology applications. Proposals submitted to this solicitation
                        should address social, ethical, and safety issues associated with
                        designing and building synthetically modified cells as an integrated

                        Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National
                        Cancer Institute (NCI) invites research grant applications (R01) for
                        the development and application of current and emerging molecular
                        imaging methods to gain fundamental insights into cancer
                        inflammation in vivo. The motivation for this initiative is the
                        recognition that much of the current imaging research on
                        inflammation in cancer relies heavily on in vitro and ex vivo
                        methods. These approaches have limited potential to provide
                        significant insights into the dynamic interactions between cancer
                        and inflammation. Utilizing molecular imaging probes in pre-clinical
                        and clinical investigations allows for precise temporal resolution
                        at molecular and cellular levels. This information is valuable for

                        pre-diagnostic blood samples from the PLCO screened arm
                        participants, and buccal cells from both the screened and the
                        control arm participants. Available data associated with the
                        biospecimens includes demographic, diet, lifestyle, smoking,
                        screening results, and other clinical data. This NOFO supports a
                        wide range of cancer research including, but not limited to,
                        biochemical and genetic analyses of cancer risk, as well as
                        discovery and validation of early detection biomarkers. The proposed
                        research project must involve use of PLCO biospecimens and may
                        include other resources; additionally, it should also take advantage
                        of the unique characteristics of the PLCO biospecimens. Research on
                        non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g.,
                        Alzheimer&rsquo;s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis and
                        rheumatoid arthritis) may also be supported. Research projects that
                        do not involve the use of PLCO biospecimens will not be supported
                        under this NOFO.

                        United States for several decades; however, certain types of cancer remain stubbornly lethal,
                        with the lowest five-year survival rates. Effective screening tests are not available for many
                        of these cancers, resulting in the late detection and diagnosis of advanced-stage malignancies
                        for which there is a lack of available therapies with curative potential. The ability to detect

                        multiple cancer types are encouraged, including the development of novel clinical trial

                        equivalent experience) and can create and deliver entrepreneurship-, technology transfer related
                        education and training materials and offer related services to IHEs that have a much lower RTRL.
                        Track 5 is designed and intended for providing support to an IHE that can coordinate research
                        translation-related activities for teams across all the other Tracks.

                        The NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research
                        educational activities that complement other formal training
                        programs in the mission areas of the NIH Institutes and Centers. The
                        overarching goals of the NIH R25 program are to: (1) complement
                        and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the
                        nation&rsquo;s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs;
                        (2) encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those
                        from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral
                        sciences, to pursue further studies or careers in research; (3) help
                        recruit individuals with specific specialty or disciplinary
                        backgrounds to research careers in biomedical, behavioral and
                        clinical sciences; and (4) foster a better understanding of
                        biomedical, behavioral and clinical research and its implications.
                        The overarching goal of this R25 program is to support educational
                        activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a
                        workforce to meet the nation&rsquo;s biomedical, behavioral and
                        clinical research needs. To accomplish the stated over-arching goal,
                        this FOA will support creative educational activities with a primary
                        focus on Research Experiences for high school students,
                        undergraduate students, and/or science teachers during the summer
                        academic break.

                        applications for Environmental Health Sciences Core Centers (EHSCC). As intellectual hubs for
                        environmental health science research, the EHSCC are expected to be the thought leaders for the
                        field and advance the goals of the 2025-2029 NIEHS Strategic Plan. The Core Centers provide
                        critical research infrastructure, shared facilities, services and/or resources, to groups of
                        investigators conducting environmental health sciences research. An EHSCC enables researchers
                        to conduct their independently-funded individual and/or collaborative research projects more
                        efficiently and/or more effectively. The overall goal of an EHSCC is to identify and capitalize
                        on emerging issues that advance improving the understanding of the relationships among
                        environmental exposures, human biology, and disease. The EHSCC supports community engagement and
                        translational research as key approaches to improving public health.
