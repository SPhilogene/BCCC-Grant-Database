                        Cycle 57 of the PSC-CUNY Research Award Program is now active. The
                        PSC-CUNY Research Award Program (&ldquo;the Program&rdquo;) seeks to
                        grow faculty research, scholarship, and creative activities in all
                        academically relevant disciplines. The Program is designed to
                        strengthen both the CUNY research enterprise and the professional
                        development of its faculty. Supported activities are expansive and
                        may include diverse research forms and methods; efforts to start,
                        continue, or finish a project; and/or pursuit of external grant
                        awards.

                        Accelerator Award is to support the commercialization of an ongoing cancer research project and
                        to validate and de-risk technologies. Proposals should address key experiment(s) required to
                        move findings toward commercialization that do not easily fit into traditional grant funding
                        mechanisms. This mechanism is not designed to initiate new projects or develop new directions
                        for an ongoing project. The proposal should be commercially driven with the PI having a plan to
                        license the technology, either to an established company or a start-up if the experiment(s) are
                        successful. Examples of research that align with the focus of this funding initiative include
                        but are not limited to: dosing, toxicity and/or efficacy testing; testing of biopsies or other
                        patient samples to correlate clinical outcome; or technologies for healthcare delivery.
                        Accelerator awardees will become part of an entrepreneurial collaborative learning community
                        focused on technology commercialization. Grantees will have access to both educational
                        programming developed by the ACS BrightEdge team and the team itself.

                        National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) aim to
                        foster the advancement and accelerate the growth of early-career scientists transitioning to
                        entrepreneurship by simultaneously supporting their entrepreneurial development and the conduct
                        of research and development under their direction. This NOFO supports small business concerns
                        (SBCs) in employing and developing researchers as entrepreneurial Program Directors/Principal
                        Investigators (PDs/PIs). In addition to supporting research and development efforts at the SBC,
                        a major component of this NOFO is entrepreneurial training, mentoring, and career development of
                        the PD/PI. Optimal PDs/PIs for this award are scientists and professionals with research,
                        technology development, and/or healthcare delivery skills and experience, but limited
                        entrepreneurial and independent (non-mentored) research leadership experience. PDs/PIs are
                        expected to grow their entrepreneurial skillset while working in a small business to develop
                        promising technologies and products that align with NIH's or CDC’s missions to improve health
                        and save lives.

                        Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National
                        Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for P50 Research Center
                        Grants for Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE).
                        Based on the research proposed, applications may be jointly funded
                        with the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
                        (NIDCR). The program will fund P50 SPORE grants to support
                        state-of-the-art investigator-initiated translational research that
                        will contribute to improved prevention, early detection, diagnosis,
                        and treatment of an organ-specific cancer or a highly related group
                        of cancers. For the purpose of this NOFO, a group of highly related
                        cancers are those that are derived from the same organ system, such
                        as gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, head and neck, and other
                        cancers. Other programmatically appropriate groups of cancers may
                        include those centered around a common biological mechanism critical
                        for promoting tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression in organ sites
                        that belong to different organ systems. For example, a SPORE may
                        focus on cancers caused by the same infectious agent or cancers
                        promoted and sustained by dysregulation of a common signaling
                        pathway. In addition, a SPORE may focus on cross-cutting themes such
                        as pediatric cancers or cancer health disparities. The research
                        supported through this program must be translational and must stem
                        from research on human biology using cellular, molecular,
                        structural, biochemical, and/or genetic experimental approaches.
                        SPORE projects must have the goal of reaching a translational human
                        endpoint within the project period of the grant.

                        Through this program, NSF establishes partnerships with government,
                        higher education, and industry that are designed to affect
                        sustainable improvements in a jurisdiction's research
                        infrastructure, Research and Development (R&amp;D) capacity, and
                        hence, its R&amp;D competitiveness. The FEC program (formerly known
                        as "EPSCoR Track-2 program") builds inter-jurisdictional
                        collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in Science, Technology,
                        Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) focus areas consistent with the
                        current National Science Foundation Strategic Plan. Projects are
                        investigator-driven and must include researchers from at least two
                        EPSCoR eligible jurisdictions with complementary expertise and
                        resources necessary to address challenges, which neither party could
                        address as well or as rapidly independently. FEC projects have a
                        comprehensive and integrated vision to drive discovery and build
                        sustainable STEM capacity that exemplifies institutional,
                        geographic, and disciplinary diversity. The projects' STEM research
                        and education activities seek to broaden participation through the
                        strategic inclusion and integration of all individuals,
                        institutions, and sectors. Additionally, EPSCoR recognizes that the
                        development of early-career faculty is critical to sustaining and
                        advancing research capacity.

                        Science and Technology Studies (STS) is an interdisciplinary field
                        that investigates the conceptual foundations, historical
                        developments and social contexts of science, technology, engineering
                        and mathematics (STEM), including medical science. The STS program
                        supports proposals across a broad spectrum of research that uses
                        historical, philosophical and social scientific methods to
                        investigate STEM theory and practice. STS research may be empirical
                        or conceptual; specifically, it may focus on the intellectual,
                        material or social facets of STEM.

                        Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National
                        Cancer Institute (NCI) invites research grant applications (R01) for
                        the development and application of current and emerging molecular
                        imaging methods to gain fundamental insights into cancer
                        inflammation in vivo. The motivation for this initiative is the
                        recognition that much of the current imaging research on
                        inflammation in cancer relies heavily on in vitro and ex vivo
                        methods. These approaches have limited potential to provide
                        significant insights into the dynamic interactions between cancer
                        and inflammation. Utilizing molecular imaging probes in pre-clinical
                        and clinical investigations allows for precise temporal resolution
                        at molecular and cellular levels. This information is valuable for
                        identifying and characterizing in vivo inflammatory cellular
                        physiology in cancer and for detecting molecular changes in response
                        to treatment. This NOFO encourages applications focused on
                        developing integrated imaging approaches to investigate the role of
                        inflammation in cancer through strong cross-discipline collaboration
                        between cancer basic science researchers and imaging scientists.
                        These collaborations are expected to advance the science and
                        understanding of cancer inflammation interactions.

                        of the primary screen assay(s) and testing in an initial pilot
                        screen; 2) primary screen implementation to identify initial
                        screening hits (high throughput target-focused screens, or moderate
                        throughput screens); 3) hit validation using a series of assays and
                        initial medicinal chemistry inspection to prioritize the hit set.

                        This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will solicit mechanistic
                        research that aims to understand how and why expectancy effects
                        occur in a cancer context, elucidate their role in cancer symptom
                        management, and identify patients, symptoms, cancer sites, and
                        contexts in which expectancy effects can be leveraged to improve
                        cancer outcomes. Expectancies are defined in this context as beliefs
                        about future outcomes, including one&rsquo;s response to cancer or
                        cancer treatment. Expectancies can be evoked by social,
                        psychological, environmental, and systemic factors. Expectancy
                        effects are the cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes
                        caused by expectancies. Expectancy effects can be generated by
                        expectancies held by patients, clinicians, family members,
                        caregivers, and/or dyadic/social networks. Program is particularly
                        interested in applications that enroll individuals and groups from

                        that propose to advance research in cancer etiology and early
                        detection biomarkers, utilizing the advantages of the unique
                        biorepository resources of the NCI-sponsored Prostate, Lung,
                        Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial. The PLCO
                        Biorepository offers high-quality, prospectively collected, serial
                        pre-diagnostic blood samples from the PLCO screened arm
                        participants, and buccal cells from both the screened and the
                        control arm participants. Available data associated with the
                        biospecimens includes demographic, diet, lifestyle, smoking,
                        screening results, and other clinical data. This NOFO supports a
                        wide range of cancer research including, but not limited to,
                        biochemical and genetic analyses of cancer risk, as well as
                        discovery and validation of early detection biomarkers. The proposed
                        research project must involve use of PLCO biospecimens and may
                        include other resources; additionally, it should also take advantage
                        of the unique characteristics of the PLCO biospecimens. Research on
                        non-cancer outcomes, especially those related to aging (e.g.,
                        Alzheimer&rsquo;s, depression, hip fracture, osteoporosis and
                        rheumatoid arthritis) may also be supported. Research projects that
                        do not involve the use of PLCO biospecimens will not be supported
                        under this NOFO.

                        The purpose of the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00)
                        program is to facilitate a timely transition of outstanding
                        postdoctoral researchers with a research and/or clinical doctorate
                        degree from mentored, postdoctoral research positions to
                        independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. The
                        program will provide independent NIH research support during this
                        transition in order to help awardees to launch competitive,
                        independent research careers.

                        their research career because of illness or pressing family
                        circumstances. Other ICs use the K01 to support career development
                        in specific fields.

                        validation of molecular/cellular/imaging markers (referred to as
                        "markers" or "biomarkers") and assays for cancer detection,
                        diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and prediction of response or
                        resistance to treatment, as well as markers for cancer prevention
                        and control. This NOFO will also support the validation of
                        pharmacodynamic markers and markers of toxicity. Applicants to this
                        NOFO must have an assay(s) whose performance has been analytically
                        validated in specimens similar to those for the intended clinical
                        use of the marker(s) and assay(s). As chemotherapies and/or
                        radiation therapies are increasingly combined with immunotherapies
                        to enhance the durability of anti-cancer responses, assays for
                        measuring multiple markers, including immune markers, can be
                        developed and validated simultaneously.

                        receptor agonists (RAs), impact cancer risk. The focus on these
                        agents is due to their reported effects on thyroid, prostate and
                        other cancer risks, and the generally more favorable efficacy and
                        side effect profile compared to other classes of incretin mimetics.
                        In addition, this NOFO seeks to draw in talented scientists to the
                        cancer biology field who may study incretin mimetic effects on

                        United States for several decades; however, certain types of cancer remain stubbornly lethal,
                        with the lowest five-year survival rates. Effective screening tests are not available for many
                        of these cancers, resulting in the late detection and diagnosis of advanced-stage malignancies
                        for which there is a lack of available therapies with curative potential. The ability to detect
                        and diagnose aggressive precursor lesions or early-stage cancers will be critical to ensuring
                        long-term survival outcomes. Unfortunately, significant advances in early cancer detection and
                        disease interception remain elusive. The projects funded through this initiative will advance
                        our understanding of the origins and risk stratification of recalcitrant cancers and accelerate
                        the development of technological and methodological innovation in early cancer detection and
                        interception. It is recognized that significant barriers to the development and clinical
                        implementation of early detection biomarkers exist, partly due to the need for rigorous testing
                        within randomized clinical trials. Ideas that are broadly applicable to early detection across
                        multiple cancer types are encouraged, including the development of novel clinical trial
                        statistical methodologies that aim to assess the validity of early detection biomarkers.

                        framework is built around five distinct Tracks that are interconnected. These Tracks are
                        differentiated by the RTRL. Track 1 is designed and intended for IHEs that currently have a low
                        to medium RTRL. The IHEs responding to Track 1 are expected to have on-going research that has
                        potential and opportunity for innovation translation but the infrastructure and the ecosystem
                        for creating such opportunities for research translation are very limited. On the other hand,
                        Track 2 is designed and intended for IHEs with some modest infrastructure and ecosystem that has
                        a high volume of research but overall low level of research translation. Tracks 3 and 4 are
                        designed and intended for IHEs or non-profits that have a significantly higher RTRL (or
                        equivalent experience) and can create and deliver entrepreneurship-, technology transfer related
                        education and training materials and offer related services to IHEs that have a much lower RTRL.
                        Track 5 is designed and intended for providing support to an IHE that can coordinate research
                        translation-related activities for teams across all the other Tracks.

                        The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) announces its
                        interest in supporting conferences through the AHRQ Single-Year and
                        Multiple-Year Conference grant programs (R13). AHRQ seeks to support
                        conferences that help further its mission to produce evidence to
                        make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable
                        and affordable, and to work with HHS and other partners to make sure
                        the evidence is understood and used.

                        applications for Environmental Health Sciences Core Centers (EHSCC). As intellectual hubs for
                        environmental health science research, the EHSCC are expected to be the thought leaders for the
                        field and advance the goals of the 2025-2029 NIEHS Strategic Plan. The Core Centers provide
                        critical research infrastructure, shared facilities, services and/or resources, to groups of
                        investigators conducting environmental health sciences research. An EHSCC enables researchers
                        to conduct their independently-funded individual and/or collaborative research projects more
                        efficiently and/or more effectively. The overall goal of an EHSCC is to identify and capitalize
                        on emerging issues that advance improving the understanding of the relationships among
                        environmental exposures, human biology, and disease. The EHSCC supports community engagement and
                        translational research as key approaches to improving public health.
